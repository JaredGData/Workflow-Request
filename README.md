# Workflow-Request
A Power BI dashboard that breaks down ticket activity across warehouses — showing who’s requesting the most work, when tickets peak, and how performance shifts by warehouse, week, and time of day.  This report helps give a quick, visual overview of operational workload and lets you slice the data by month, warehouse, requester group, and more.
